K-Means Clustering Algorithm:
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The analysis and visualization help identify distinct customer groups using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Project Structure:
The project includes steps for loading and standardizing the data, determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, applying the K-Means algorithm, and analyzing and visualizing the results.

Libraries Used:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

How It Works:
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The customer data is loaded and standardized.
Elbow Method: The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
K-Means Clustering: The K-Means algorithm is applied to segment the customers into clusters.
Analysis and Visualization: The resulting clusters are analyzed and visualized to identify distinct customer segments.
